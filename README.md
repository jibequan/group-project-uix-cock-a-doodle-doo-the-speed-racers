## Cock-A-Doodle-Doo - Group Project - a Single Page Application

>  This begun as a [Nashville Software School's](http://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/) team project to create a Single Page Application that is essentially a dashboard for a user to use when they wake up in the morning to keep track of the weather, news, etc.

### Technical Considerations
* You will be getting data from different APIs.
* User authentication using Firebase.
* The application must have CRUD functionality with the Firebase database.
* Consider encapsulating all Firebase calls into a single module.
* Use SASS to control your color themes.
* Incorporate a CSS grid framework

### Technology Requirements
* SASS 
* Grunt (with JSHINT) 
* Promises
* Browserify
* Grid framework of your choice
* Firebase for data storage and retrieval.
